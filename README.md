A couple scripts to deal with csv data and geolocation services

## IPGeoLocation
See README.md in `IPGeoLocation/` and RUNNING.md

## Mappify.io
See `mappify.sh` for bash script to ask [mappify.io]() to geocode the lat lng into postcodes.
It should work but currently mappify.io is returning slightly invalid JSON.
